- Hi, I’m Ada!
- I’m interested in puzzles, music, and art
- I’m a 4th year student studying Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts with a Computer Science minor ar UCSD
- Feel free to send me an email at theadaburton@gmail.com

- I'm currently looking to develop my skills in rust, and trying to get in the habit of contributing to projects I use, as well as starting some of my own!
- I am interested in writing software that enables artists to create more interesting work with more direct control over the process by which the art is produced either statically or dynamically, including entropic and evolving works that incorporate the change over time of culture, the web, and information.
